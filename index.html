                        I am an enthusiastic and curious tech professional with a solid foundation in Information Technology, having completed my studies at Kabarak University. My journey through the world of tech has been driven by a genuine passion for innovation and problem-solving. Currently, I am putting that passion into practice by teaching technology at The Cube Innovation Hub, where I mentor young minds and collaborate on exciting projects that push the boundaries of creativity and tech education.

                        What excites me most about this field is its ever-evolving nature. I’m especially drawn to research and emerging technologies — always eager to explore the next big thing, whether it's in AI, IoT, or how tech can be applied to real-world challenges. This constant state of learning and discovery keeps me energized and motivated.
                        
                        Teaching has not only sharpened my communication and leadership skills but has also deepened my understanding of how to make complex concepts relatable and engaging. It’s fulfilling to see learners grow in confidence as they build and create, and I take pride in being part of that journey.
                        
                        I'm a confident individual who thrives in dynamic environments where innovation and experimentation are encouraged. I believe in the power of tech to shape the future and love being part of a community that shares that vision. Whether I'm diving into a research paper, tinkering with a new device, or leading a coding workshop, I bring energy, focus, and a genuine love for what I do.
